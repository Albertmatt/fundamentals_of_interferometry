    "Astronomical observations are all about measuring the radiation from astronomical sources to infer the physical properties of these sources. So we'll first discuss how measurement of radiation from astronomical sources is quantified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total energy per unit time emitted by a source is its luminosity, typically denoted as $L$. This has units of Watts per second - or ergs per second if you prefer CGS units. This is the energy added over all the frequencies at which the source emits radiation (no astronomical source emits radiation at a single frequency). This is also known as the 'bolometric luminosity'. More often, however, the luminosity of a source at a particular frequency is given. This is the 'spectral luminosity' of the source, denoted as $L_{\\nu}$ (*$\\nu$ will denote frequency, throughout the book*). The suffix is to remind us that :\n",
    "$$L = \\int L_{\\nu}\\, d\\nu \\qquad .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral luminosity gets an extra $Hz^{-1}$ (Hertz) unit, since it is power (energy per unit time) at a given frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, astronomers cannot measure the luminosity of the source (since only a part of the total energy is intercepted by any telescope), but infer it under the assumption of a certain geometry of the radiation field (often assumed to be isotropic).\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of power which we receive at the telescope depends on the collecting surface of a telescope. The quantity independent of the measurement is a different one, namely the (spectral) power flux, or the so-called flux density (sometimes flux is used synonymously) $S_\\nu$, which, for an isotropic radiation field of a point source, can be written as : \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S_{\\nu} = \\frac{L_{\\nu}}{4\\pi \\, D^{2}} \\qquad ,$$\n",

    "L_{\\nu} \\,&=\\, \\int S_{\\nu}(R, \\theta, \\phi)\\,d\\Omega\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "where R is a constant distance and $S_\\nu(R,\\, \\theta,\\, \\phi)$ denotes the flux density generated by the source at the position described by $R$, $\\theta$, and $\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flux density has units of ${\\rm W}\\,{\\rm m}^{-2} \\,{\\rm Hz}^{-1}$. Radio astronomers prefer to measure the flux density in units of Jansky, denoted by the symbol 'Jy', with $$1 \\, {\\rm Jy}\\, =\\, 10^{-26}\\, {\\rm W}\\, {\\rm m}^{-2}\\, {\\rm Hz}^{-1} $$ ! This is due to radio signals from extragalactic sources being rather weak. \n",
    "For example, Cygnus A, the closest extragalactic radio source has a flux of $1590$ Jy at $1.4$ GHz (see [Photometric Data for Cygnus A &#10548;](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/datasearch?search_type=Photo_id&objid=56031&objname=Cygnus%20A&img_stamp=YES&hconst=73.0&omegam=0.27&omegav=0.73&corr_z=1&of=table)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The flux density measures the spectral flux of a single source without giving any information about the direction from which the radiation is emitted and about the source structure. Obviously, though, a measurement contains that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is hence measured is the average of another quantity over a limited solid angle (the instrumental function, ideally, of course the quantity is measured directly). The (specific) intensity, or brightness specifies the flux density per solid angle from a certain direction of the sky. It is defined via the infinitesimal power $dP$ permeating an infinitesimal surface $dA$ from the direction of the solid angle element $d\\Omega$ over the infinitesimal frequency range $d\\nu$"
