    "\n",
    "As astronomers, we are interested in the light from celestial objects: we are interested in the electromagnetic waves these objects emit. Light is tricky because it behaves both as a wave (EM wave) and a particle (photon); this behaviour is best explored in a particle physics course. When it comes to radio astronomy, the light we observe is sufficiently low-energy that it is best treated as a wave rather than a particle; the wave-particle dichotomy will thus not be covered here, and we will treat light purely as a transverse wave in the EM field.\n",

    "\n",
    "These equations can be simplified by considering a region with no charges ($\\rho=0$) and no current ($J=0$). Let us do so, and take the curl (i.e. matrix product with $\\nabla$) of equations (3) and (4):\n",

    "\n",
    "We have thus shown that the very nature of Maxwell's equations mean that electromagnetic waves must exist, a result reached by Maxwell himself. He also noted that the speed he predicted - based on measuring permissivity and permeability - was in perfect agreement with the value of the speed of light, known through an independent measurement by astronomer Ole Roemer! This was strong indication - later vindicted in an experiment by Heinrich Hertz - that radio waves (and therefore light) were oscillations of an electric field.\n",

    "The final step to fully represent the signal our antennas monitor is to encode polarisation information into our EM wave. Here, we will only introduce the mathematical formalism with which this is usually done, in order to complete our discussion on the mathematical description of EM waves.\n",

    "Polarisation describes the situation where the frame of reference of your EM-wave (e.g. $E_x,E_y$) is rotated with respect to the frame of reference of your E-field ($E_{0x},E_{0y}$). This can occur when light travels through interstellar magnetic fields, such as ones found in ionised plasma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polarisation information is encoded in our final wavefunction using **Jones calculus**. This is not quite the most general framework in which to treat polarisation, but it will suffice for our needs (for keen readers, Mueller calculus is an extension of Jones calculus which allows users to treat polarisation more fully).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is basically to characterise the polarisation as a phase shifts ($\\phi_0$ in Eq (15) ) from the frame of reference of your E-field. In other words, the complex amplitude of E becomes: \n",

This is the energy added over all the frequencies at which the source emits radiation (no astronomical source emits radiation at a single frequency). This is also known as the 'bolometric luminosity'. More often, however, the luminosity of a source at a particular frequency is given. This is the 'spectral luminosity' of the source, denoted as $L_{\\nu}$ (*$\\nu$ will denote frequency, throughout the book*). The suffix is to remind us that :\n",
