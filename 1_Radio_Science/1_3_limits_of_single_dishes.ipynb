    "There are certain physical limitations to account for when designing single dish radio telescopes. As an example, consider that, due to its limited Field of View and the rotation of the earth, an antenna will have to track a source on the sky to maintain a constant sensitivity. In principle this can be achieved by mounting the antenna on a pedestal and mechnically steering it with a suitable engine (or engines). However, in order to maintain the integrity of the antenna, the control systems for these engines have to be incredibly precise. Clearly this gets harder as the size of the instrument increases and will constitute a critical design point on the engineering side. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually there is an upper limit on how large we can build steerable single dish radio telescopes. This is because, just like everything else, the metals that these telescopes are made out of can only withstand finite amounts of stress and strain before deforming. Perhaps one of the greatest reminders of this fact came in 1988 with the fall of the early Green Bank Telescope (see **Figure 1** below (ref: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ASPC..395..323C)). Clearly, large steerable telescopes run the risk of collapsing under their own weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "Larger apertures can still be reached in other ways. For example, leaving the reflector fixed and allowing the receiver at the prime focus to move along the focal plane (or along the caustic) of the instrument will mimic a slowly varying pointing in the sky (a so called steerable focus telescope). Indeed this is how the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope (see **Figure 2**) operates. However, steerable focus telescopes come with limitations of their own (e.g. material cost and available space). Does this mean that we will never be able to observe the radio Universe at resolutions comparable to the visible? Fortunately we can exploit the principle of superposition to synthesize a larger dish from an array of smaller dishes i.e. build a radio interferometer. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1** and **Figure 2** show examples of the largest steerable telescopes that can be made:\n",

    "Here we will attempt to develop some intuition for what an interferometer actually does. Before getting into the math lets see if we can use what we know about optical telescopes to build an interferometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single optical telescope generally comes as a combination of a main reflector (primary mirror which will define the aperture of the telescope) and a receiver (a collecting device such as a CCD). The purpose of this mirror is to gather light over some aperture and focus it onto a focal plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic optics tells us how convex lenses can be used to form real local images of sources that are very far away. Actually, the conjugate image of a source that is infinitely far away will form at exactly the focal point of the lens, the location of which is completely determined by the shape of the lens (under the \"thin lens\" approximation and as long as the Gaussian conditions hold). Sources of astrophysical interest can be approximated as being infinitely far away as long as they are at distances much farther away than the focal point of the lens. This is immediately obvious from the equation of a thin convex lens viz.\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{o} + \\frac{1}{i} = \\frac{1}{f}, $$\n",
    "where $i, ~ o$ and $f$ are the image, object and focal distances respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early astronomers exploited this useful property of lenses to build the first optical telescopes. Later on concave mirrors replaced lenses because it was easier to control their physical and optical properties (e.g. curvature, surface quality etc.). These days large telescopes (with $D \\gtrsim 8m$ say) almost exclusively use mirrors because of their easier, single piece design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfectly reflective circular paraboloids are the most efficient at focussing incoming plane waves (travelling on-axis) into a single locus (the focal point). Circular paraboloids are therefore a good choice for the shape of a collector. \n",

    "\n",
    "We start with a parabolic optical telescope which receives light from various directions. Assuming that the optical components are perfect, the signal coming from the source at an infinite distance away has its image lying in the focal plane. This is therefore where we put the receiver (in the visible case the receiver could be a CCD (Charged-Coupled Device) that collects photons).\n",

    "**Step 2: Breaking the mirror**\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of breaking the mirror into pieces does not change the main properties of the telescope. Only some portions of the primary reflector are missing (we could also have obstructed or colored in black the mirror surface at different locations). It is still possible to recover an image at the focal point. However the image will be sligthly distorted due to the loss of continuity of the aperture.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Change of wavelength**\n",
    "\n",
    "We now switch from the visible to the radio. Since they are both a form of electro-magnetic (EM) radiation we can extrapolate the same optical concepts to the lower frequencies of the radio domain. The only real change is to adapt the reflective and receiving systems to match the wavelength (i.e. metal reflectors are sufficient to replace polished mirrors, and a small radio feed can capture the EM waves instead of collecting photons on a CCD).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Conversion into electronics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushing it further, we can replace the radio reflective parts by sensitive parts which will directly measure the EM waves arriving at each portion of the surface and transmit it to the receiver. The conversion between the EM waves and the electrical signal is performed by an antenna (recall that an antenna as an EM transducer, it converts an electric field into an alternating current). \n",
    "\n",
    "With each piece of the former reflector now acting as an antenna, the incoming signal propagates through the wires (more correctly transmission lines). Therefore, as long as we keep track of the discrepencies in phase caused by the signal traversing different distances (something we will revisit later), we can move the receivers around freely without altering the parabolic shape of the antenna.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5 & 6: Deconstructing the parabola**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, by carefully keeping track of the above mentioned phase discrepencies (effectively this amounts to adding more cable), we can reproduce the difference in arrival times between all the pieces. As for the receiver, we are now free to arrange the receiving pieces into a more manageable configuration (i.e. we can place them all on the ground). Also note that we could spread the array of telescopes over a bigger area to achieve better resolution."
