This final section provides an overview of some of the interferometric arrays currently in use, the science goals of these projects, and future arrays in development.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the scale and cost of science in physics has grown there is a drive for international collaboration to pool  resources in order to build large, multi-purpose arrays. These arrays are meant to run as long term observatories with astronomers requesting time for a proposed projects. The prime example of this type of array is the future Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Another array type is an *ad-hoc* array such as in very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) where single dish telescopes (or beamformed arrays) from all over the world are combined (via a signal recorder) for an observation. The recorded signals are later sent to a correlator to create an interferometric observation. There are also experiment-driven arrays which are focused on a single experimental outcome with a limited lifetime. Many of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) arrays follow this model."
