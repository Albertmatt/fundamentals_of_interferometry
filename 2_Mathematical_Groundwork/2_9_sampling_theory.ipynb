In other words, how finely a function has to be sampled to ideally recover the function: given the diameter of a telescope, or given the maximum separation of two telescopes in an interferometer, what pixel size do we choose in our reconstructed image? With the aid of Fourier theory, we can give an accurate answer to this for a set of functions."

Again, the Nyquist rate is twice the Nyquist frequency, for a signal with a bandwidth of 500 Hz has to be sampled at a frequency of 1000 Hz, once every ms.
