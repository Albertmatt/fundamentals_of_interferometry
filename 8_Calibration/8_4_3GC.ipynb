    "As explained in [Chapter 7 &#10142;](../7_Observing_Systems/7_0_introduction) , the increased field-of-view of modern telescopes \n",
    "causes direction-dependent effects, like the primary beam and pointing error, to become apparent. We can therefore no longer merely rely on using direction-independent selfcal (see [Sec. 8.3 &#10142;](../8_Calibration/8_3_2GC.ipynb)). There are in principal many approaches one can use to perform direction-dependent calibration (see [Sec. 8.4.1 &#10549;](#cal:sec:p_versus_h) for more details).\n",
    "\n",
    "I this section we will mainly concentrate on one specific approach: *differential gains* ([<cite data-cite='Smirnov2011'>Revisiting the radio interferometer measurement equation-II.  Calibration and direction-dependent effects</cite> &#10548;](http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1765)). The reason being, this approach provides a nice framework with which one can build up some intiution as to how direction-dependent calibration differs from direction-independent calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Sec. 7.2 &#10142;](../7_Observing_Systems/7_2_rime.ipynb) the following equation was\n",
    "presented:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{V}_{pq} = \\mathbf{G}_p\\mathbf{X}_{pq}\\mathbf{G}_q^H,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is known as the all-sky RIME, where $\\mathbf{V}_{pq}$ is the $2\\times2$ correlation matrix that the interferometer measured and $\\mathbf{X}_{pq}$ is the $2\\times2$ coherency matrix. Moreover, $\\mathbf{G}_p$ and $\\mathbf{G}_q$ are G-Jones antenna matrices. During calibration we estimate $\\mathbf{G}_p$ and $\\mathbf{G}_p$ which we then in turn use to correct the correlation matrix $\\mathbf{V}_{pq}$. The subscripts $p$ and $q$ denote the antennas with which the measurement was made. Furthermore, $\\mathbf{X}_{pq} = \\sum_s \\mathbf{X}_{spq}$, with $s$ being the source index. The implication being, we assume that the error that corrupts our visibilities is independent of the source's position. As explained in [Sec. 7.3 &#10142;](../7_Observing_Systems/7_3_direction_independent_and_dependent_effects.ipynb), this assumption is violated when we work with a larger field-of-view. As an example, the primary beam of an instrument varies significantly over a large field-of-view (generally in time and frequency). In the case of the primary beam we could try to model the direction dependent effect by adding an a-priori $\\mathbf{E}$ Jones matrix to our Jones' chain (see [<cite data-cite='Mitra2015'>Incorporation of antenna primary beam patterns in radio-interferometric data reduction to produce wide-field, high-dynamic-range images</cite> &#10548;](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/defdeny.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D7297163%26userType%3Dinst&denyReason=-134&arnumber=7297163&productsMatched=null&userType=inst)). However, if we do not have any information about the physical source that is responsible for a direction dependent effect then we could use the idea of differential gains instead. In addition to to the direction-independent gain every source experiences we add a differential gain which could be different for each source. Mathematically, we can express this as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{V}_{pq} = \\mathbf{G}_p \\left (\\sum_s\\Delta\\mathbf{E}_{sp}\\mathbf{X}_{spq}\\Delta\\mathbf{E}_{sq}^H \\right) \\mathbf{G}_q^H,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\Delta\\mathbf{E}_{sp}$ and $\\Delta\\mathbf{E}_{sq}^H$ are the differential gains associated with source $s$ and antenna $p$ and $q$ respectively.\n",
    "We now use the above equation and least squares (see [Sec. 8.1 &#10142;](../8_Calibration/8_1_Calibration_Least_Squares_Problem.ipynb)) to estimate the unknown diferrential and direction independent gains, which we can then subsequently use to correct our correlation measurements. "
