    "In the previous section we introduced the concept of iterative deconvolution using a point-source approximation to the sky, akso known as `CLEAN`. The example is more precisely an image-domain implementation of `CLEAN`. There are in fact multiple variants of `CLEAN` as it has been extended over the years to improve results, mainly due to advancements in computing power that have lead to more compute intensive operations being possible. Today there is an active field of developing more advanced `CLEAN` implementation and deconvolution algorithms which can solve special cases. These will be breifly discussed at the end of this section. We will first discuss the implementation and advantages/disadvantages of the basic variants of `CLEAN`: image-domain, gridded visibility-domain, and visibility-domain."

Thus, $\\gamma$ is set somewhere between 0 and 1, a typical value would be $0.1$, this means that each iteration 10% of the peak flux value is subtracted from the residual image. If the loop gain is too high then the deconvolution maybe over ambitious and subtract out noise from the image, leading to 'holes' in the image.

    "This is the simplest implementation of `CLEAN` but is also limited as one would expect from being the original `CLEAN` method. The first issue is that the residual image and PSF are images with a fixed number of pixels. When subtracting flux from the residual image the PSF is offset, thus flux from only a subset of the residual image is subtracted. This requires either computing a PSF image at least twice as large (in both directions for 4 times the number of pixels), or limiting deconvolution to the centre of the residual image. The second issue is that the sky model is fixed to the resolution of the pixels in the residual image, this leads to artefacts as sources are never perfectly at the centre of a pixel. Accounting for these issues lead to the next developments in `CLEAN`."

The general structure of his method was to search for a set of bright pixels in the image domain (above some threshold based on the PSF sidelobes), build a partial sky model in the 'minor' cycle. The partial sky model needs to be convolved with the PSF before being subtracted from the residual image. Using the Fourier transform and convolution theorem the the sky model and PSF can be Fourier transformed and multiplied together in the visibility domain, and since the Fourier transform is a linear transform, can be subtracted from the gridded visibilities of the residual image. The new residual image is then the Fourier transform of these new residual visibilities. This has the advantage of potentially being faster than Högbom's method, and allows for deconvolution over a larger portion of the image. This implementation in pseudo-code is:"

The function also returns the ratio $R_{\\textrm{PSF}}$ of the the highest PSF sidelobe to the PSF main lobe, this will be less than 1. The justification for truncating the PSF is that the majority of the power in the PSF is contained within this region. And, any pixel in the image which is higher than the first sidelobe (as a fraction of the peak pixel flux) contains a source. The trade-off in the size of the PSF subset is that the smaller it is the more of the image can be deconvolved, but at the cost of increased errors. The larger the PSF subset the smaller the image region which can be deconvolved, but the less error-prone the deconvolution.\n",

The limitations are that because the source subtraction is done on gridded visibilities this can result in errors due to the gridding and aliasing effects."

    "`CLEAN` methods were first implemented in a time of limited computing and memory resources. Careful consideration was required in optimizing these deconvolution methods with in these constraints. This led to good approximate solutions to deconvolution. As computing power and memory has become cheaper more advanced deconvolution methods are continuously in development. These methods are beyond the scope of the course, but are part of an active field of research. See the end of this chapter for [references &#10142;](6_x_further_reading_and_references.ipynb) to current work.\n",

    "After Clark's method the next major advancement was in 1984, [<cite data-cite='1984AJ.....89.1076S'>Schwab</cite> &#10548;](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1984AJ.....89.1076S) introduced a modifcation on Clark's method which performs the deconvolution on the ungridded visibilities. Just to be clear, the ungridded visibilities are the visibilities produced during an observation, before they are gridded onto a 2-D plane as descirbed in [$\\S$ 5.3](../5_Imaging/5_3_gridding_and_degridding.ipynb). The Cotton-Schwab method allows for deconvolution across the entire image and does not introduce PSF artefact aliasing at the cost of an increase in computation and memory usage. The Cotton-Schwab method is still widely used today and is the basis for most subsequent `CLEAN` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as `CLEAN` is a general term for deconvolution using an iterative sky model subtraction process, the Cotton-Schwab method can vary based on implementation and which additional features are included. As such, it is not possible to write an easy pseudo-code implementation in the abstract. But, at a high level the Cotton-Schwab method follows Clark's major/minor cycle model. But, instead of subtracting the gridded visibilities from the sky model in the major cycle, a method is used to compute the ungridded visibilities for the sky model. There are two methods to generate ungridded visibilities from the sky model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If there are only a few sources in the sky model a direct Fourier transform can be used on each source to compute the exact visibilities for each *uv* sample.\n",
    "2. When there are meny sources in the sky model, as is usually the case, the sky model is transformed to gridded visibilities as in Clark's methods then a [de-gridder &#10142;](../5_Imaging/5_3_gridding_and_degridding.ipynb) is used to make a close approximation to the ungridded visibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visibilities based on the sky model, often called *model visibilities*, can be used in the 'self-cal cycle', which is discussed in [$\\S$8.3](../8_Calibration/8_2_1GC.ipynb). The model visibilities are subtracted from the observed visibilities resulting in *residual visibilities*. The residual visibilities are then imaged to produce a new residual image and the next iteration of deconovlution can proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deconvolving with the ungridded visibilities has a number of other advantages to Högbom and Clark's methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are no PSF aliasing effects because the deconvolution is independent of image size.\n",
    "* Spatial regions of interest can be separately deconvolved or ignored, allowing for fine control over the sky modelling process.\n",
    "* The w-term can be accounted for when producing the residual image from the sky model resulting in a more accurate sky model and fewer artefacts in the residual image.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it should be clear that the Cotton-Schwab method (and all its derivative methods) has many advantages over the methods discussed previously in this section, and is the standard `CLEAN` deconvolution method today. It is important to note here that when the discussion of computing limits in deconvolution the gridding/de-gridding process dominates the computational operations and memory budget over all other steps. Complementary to the development of new deconvolution algorithms is the topic of efficient implementation of well developed methods. Högbom and Clark's methods are still used in some cases, such as in simple fields, and are useful to understand as there is a progression from their simplicity to the more complex modern forms of `CLEAN` used today."
