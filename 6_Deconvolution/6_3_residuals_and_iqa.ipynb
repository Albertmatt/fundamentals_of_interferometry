    "3. residuals: what remains, what is the cause of the remaining structure (over/under clean, w-term, large scale structure of extended sources, poor clean settings)\n",
    "4. image quality assessment is really hard to automate because it is a complex opinion which is based on previous experience and is hard to reduce down to simple metrics, this needs more work\n",
    "5. once we are happy with the sky model and restored image, what now? we need to make a judgement call about what is a source, and what is noise, and if sky model components are localized enough to be considered part of the same source. for this we need source finding."
