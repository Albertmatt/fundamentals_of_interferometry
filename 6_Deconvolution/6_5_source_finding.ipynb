    "# Introduction\n",
    "In radio astronomy, *source finding* is the process through which the attributes of radio sources -- such as flux density and mophorlogy -- are measured from data. We will only cover source finding in the image plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Source finding techniques usually involve four steps, i) charecterizing the noise (or background estimation), ii) thresholding the data based on knowledge of the noise, iii) fidinding regions in the thresholded image which neighbouring pixels are \"similar\" (this process is often called *blob detection*), and iv) parameterizing these blobs through a carefully chosen function (usually a 2D Gaussian). The source attribues are then estimated from the parameterization of the blobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Noise charecterization\n",
    "As mentioned before, the radio data we process with source finders is noisy. In fact, radio images are generally dominated by noise. To charecterise this noise we need to make a few assumptions about its nature, namely we assume that the niose results from some stochastic process and that it can be described by a normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G(x| \\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\text{exp}\\left( \\frac{-(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where, $\\mu$ is the mean (or expected value) of the varaible $x$, and $\\sigma^2$ is the varience of the distribution; $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation. Hence, the noise can be parameterized through the mean and the standard deviation. Let us illustrate this with an example. Bellow is a noise image from a MeerKAT simulation, along with a histogram of of the pixels (in log space)."

    "Now, in reality the noise has to measured in the presence of astrophysical emission. Futhermore, radio iamges are also contaminated by various instrumental effects which manifest as spurious emission in radio images. All these factors make it difficult to charercterize the noise in a radio image. However, since the noise generally dominates the images, the mean and standard deviation of the entire image are still fairly good approximations of the noise. Let us now insert a few sources in the noise image from earlier and then try to estimate noise."

    "As can be seen from the plot above, the standard deviation of the noise is badly overestimated, and we need a beeter way to estimate the noise. A very good way to estimate varience of the noise in images to measure the dispersion of the data points about the mean (or median). This is the so-called mean/median absolute deviation (MAD). We will refer to the to median absolute deviation as the *MAD Median*, and the mean absolute deviation as the *MAD Mean*. Another fairly simple way to get a good estimate of the varience of the noise is to only consider the negative pixels in a radio image. This works under the assumption that all the astrophysical emission (at least in Stokes I) has a positive flux density. The Figure below shows noise estimates from methods mentioned above. "
