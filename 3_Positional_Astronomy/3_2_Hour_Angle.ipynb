    "The natrual question now arises, why do we need separate time-keeping systems to keep track of the stars and the sun? The answer is that a *sidereal day* is 4 minutes shorter than a *solar day*. A solar day is the time it takes for the sun to return to the same position in the sky, while a sidereal day is the amount of time it takes for an arbitrary star to return to the same location in the sky. We can explain the reason for this time difference with the aid of Fig. [Fig. 3.2.2  &#10549;](#pos:fig:sidereal) <!--\\ref{pos:fig:sidereal}-->. When the sun reappears at the same location in the sky (after 24 hours) it appears to have moved on the celestial sphere (it has moved relative to the background stars). The apparent movement of the sun on the celestial sphere is due to the fact that the earth needs to complete a little bit more than one full rotation for the sun to reappear at the same position in the sky which in turn comes about due to the fact that the earth orbits the sun. Since the background stars are much further away the earth only needs one full rotation (23 hours and 56 minutes) for an arbitrary star to reappear at the same position in the sky."

    "We are now in a position to attain a better understanding of what the vernal equinox physically represents. As discussed in the previous paragraph the sun appears to move on the celestial sphere (its right ascension and declination changes throughout the year). As mentioned in [$\\S$ 3.1 &#10142;](3_1_Equatorial_Coordinates.ipynb), the imaginary path it traverses on the celestial sphere is known as the ecliptic. The ecliptic is depicted in [Fig. 3.2.3  &#10549;](#pos:fig:radec) <!--\\ref{pos:fig:radec}-->. The vernal equinox is the point on the celestial sphere where the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north. The vernal equinox is currently in Pisces, but used to be in Airies. Which is why it is also known as the first point of Airies. It has moved due to *precession* (the change in the orientation of earth's rotational axis). "
