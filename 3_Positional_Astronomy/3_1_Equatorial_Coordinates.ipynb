    "We also require a coordinate system to map the stars. For all intents and purposes we may think of our universe as being projected onto a sphere of arbitrary radius. This sphere surrounds the Earth and is known as the *celestial sphere*. This is not a true representation of our universe, but it is a very useful approximate astronomical construct. The *celestial equator* is obtained by projecting the equator of the earth onto the celestial sphere. The stars themselves do not move on the celestial sphere and therefore have a unique location on it. The Sun is an exception, it changes position in a periodic fashion during the year (as the Earth orbits around the Sun). The path it traverses on the celestial sphere is known as the *ecliptic*.\n",
