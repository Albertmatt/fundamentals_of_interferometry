    "Most people have a basic understanding of planar trigonometry. In this section we explore how  trigonometry can be extended into the spherical realm. Spherical trigonometry is a branch of spherical geometry in which we study the relationship between the sides and angles of *spherical triangles*. Spherical triangles are formed by the pairwise intersection of three *great circlular* arcs in three vertices. A great circular arc is an arc segment of a *great circle*. A great circle is formed by the intersection of a sphere and a plane that passes through the center of the sphere. It is possible to derive the following basic spherical trigonometric identities by studying arbitrary spherical triangles that are located on the unit sphere:\n",

This sphere surrounds the Earth and is known as the *celestial sphere*. This is not a true representation of our universe, but it is a very usefull construct that we use to keep track of the stars in the night sky. The *north celestial pole* (NCP) is an important location on the celestial sphere and is obtained by projecting the north pole of the earth onto the celestial sphere. The star *Polaris* is very close to the NCP. The *south celestial pole* (SCP) is obtained in a similar way. The imaginary circle known as the *celestial equator* is in the same plane as the equator of the earth and is obtained by projecting the equator of the earth onto the celestial sphere.\n",

The *hour circle* of an object is the circle on the celestial sphere that crosses the NCP and the object itself and is perpendicular to the celestial equator. The right ascension of an object is the angular distance between the vernal equinox and the hour circle of a celestial object measured along the celestial equator and is measured in an easterly direction. The declination of an object is the  angular distance it is away from the celestial equator measured along its hour circle (it is positive in the northern celestial hemisphere and negative in the southern celestial hemisphere).

    "*Zenith* is the position on the celestial sphere which lies directly above an observer on earth. The *local meridian* is the hour circle on the celestial sphere which we form when we connect the NCP with zenith. Celestial objects rise in the east reach their highest point when they cross the local meridian (we say they are at transit) and set in the west. The *hour angle* (denoted with $H$) of a celestial body is the angular distance (measured in hours) between the hour circle of a celesteal object and the local meridian measured along the celestial equator in a westerly direction. In other words, the hour angle is the time that still needs to pass before a celestial body is at transit if it is negative or the time since it was at transit if it is positive. We can therefore use it instead of right ascension as a celestial longitude to keep track of the stars as they move accros the sky when observed from a fixed point on earth.  "

    "Our wrist watches keep track of when the sun will be at transit. The solar time-keeping system which our wrist watches use ensures that our working day contains as many daylight hours as possible. Astronomers are however more intereseted in keeping track of the stars, since they want to observe them. They therefore use a sidereal time-keeping system to keep track of the vernal equinox (instead of the sun). The hour angle of the first point of airies is actually your *local sideral time*. Once you know the time before or since the vernal equinox was at transit you can easily determine when any other star will be at transit.

    "The natrual question now arises, why do we need separate time-keeping systems to keep track of the stars and the sun? The asnwer is that a *sidereal day* is 4 minutes shorter than a *solar day*. A solar day is the time it takes for the sun to return to the same position in the sky, while a sidereal day is the amount of time it takes for an arbitrary star to return to the same location in the sky. We can explain the reason for this time difference with the aid of Fig. [INREF](#\\label{fig:sidereal}). When the sun reappears at the same location in the sky (after 24 hours) it appears to have moved on the celestial sphere (it has moved relative to the background stars). The apparent movement of the sun on the celestial sphere is due to the fact that the earth needs to complete a little bit more than one full rotation for the sun to reappear at the same position in the sky which comes about due to the fact that the earth also orbits the sun. Since the background stars are much further away the earth only needs one full rotation (23 hours and 56 minutes) for an arbitrary star to reappear at the same position in the sky."

    "We are now able to explain what the vernal equinox actually is. As discussed in the previous paragraph the sun appears to move on the celestial sphere (in reality its right ascension and declination changes during the year). The imaginary path it traverses on the celestial sphere is known as the *ecliptic*. The vernal equinox is the point on the clestial sphere where the sun crosses the celestial equator from north to south. The vernal equinox is currently in Pisces, but used to be in Airies. Which is why it is also known as the first point of Airies. It has moved due to *precession* (the change in the orientation of earth's rotational axis). \n"
