      "Interferometry is a fundamental technique used in radio astronomy but is difficult to understand. The technique is rarely used in other fields of astronomy and physics. Many of our intutions about imaging, which comes from cameras and out own eyes, hide the underlying transformations which are central to interferometer theory. With this book we hope to present a useful entry point into the topic by sticking to the fundamentals of the topic which is appropriate for a masters or doctoral student who is starting on the subject.\n",

      "A global glossary defines all mathematical notation and useful definitions. If there is a conflict or duplicate use of notation within the book then all definitions will be described in the glossary including the scope in which the notation is used. If you want to include a specific definition to a word or phase, then italicize the text the first time you use it in a section or chapter and add the term to the glossary.\n",

      "\n",
      "Each chapter is contained in a seperate directory, the directory name has the convention of the chapter number and chapter name, with spaces replaced by underscores, e.g. `6_deconvolution_in_imaging`. The directory will only contain notebooks, any data or additional files will be in a seperate global data directory which includes a duplicately named directory for each chapter in which to store the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notebook naming should be prefixed with either a sequential number or alphabet character based on ordering in the chapter. Like directories, the notebook name should be the section name (with underscores to replace spaces), a shortened version of the section is also fine, e.g. `A_sky_models.ipynb`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Notebook Breadth\n",
      "\n",
      "Each chapter is made up of multiple sections, each of which is possibly made up of sub-section, et cetera. To keep notebooks a reasonable and consumable size, a notebook should only contain a single section. For long sections it may be reasonable to further break up a section into multiple notebooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Notebook Header\n",
      "\n",
      "The beginning of each notebook should with a set of navigation links including a link to the global outline (this notebook), glossary, the chapter specific introduction notebook, the previous section notebook, and the next section notebook. See example section 5.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the navigation links the standard python modules and any section specific modules should be imported, see 'A Note on Software' above for the current standard module import command. Following these import commands the notebook should start with a heading entry for the notebook with text that corresponds to the outlien text above, see 'Section and Subsection Headings' for sizes below.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Chapter Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The final notebook of a chapter should contain a section on further reading which contains links to papers and books, it may be useful to write a sentence about why a link is useful. Additionally, there should be a section which contains a list of all the external references noted in the chapter. Further, the conclusion to a chapter may contain a review of the topics covered in the chapter, but is not necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Section and Subsection Headings:\n",
      "\n",
      "In a notebook, section names, e.g. 5.1 Spatial Frequencies, should use the heading size 2. While each subsequent sub-section should increase the heading size, e.g. a sub-section will be size 3, a sub-sub-section will be size 4,...\n",

      "#### References, Internal and External:\n",

      "One of the limitations of the ipython notebook is the inability to render equation, figure, and table labels properly. For the moment, we have settled on a consistent, but inelegant standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Linking to internal (i.e. within the same notebook) and external (i.e. other notebooks in the book) references will use a dual method of using the standard markdown HREF and a LaTeX style so that dynamic links will work in the notebooks and conversion to PDF via LaTeX will contain references.\n",
      "\n",
      "Internal links to references are created by adding the string `INREF` as the link, e.g. `[INREF](#destination)`. A reference is created by including `<a id='destination'></a>` where the desired reference desition is to be placed. In addition to the ipython notebook dynamic links LaTeX references should be included with the `\\label{destination}` and `\\ref{destination}` tags. An example of a complete internal reference is\n",

      "```\n",

For example a table in the Imaging chapter which contains information on weights could have the label `imaging:tbl:weights`. The `chapterStr` for each chapter is to be defined by the authors. If a section of a chapter is sufficiently large it shoud have its own `chapterStr`, perhaps with the prefix including the chapter `chapterStr`. The following are valid strings for `type`: `tbl` (table), `fig` (figure), `sec` (section), `code` (code block), `eq` (equation). The `uniqueID` is left to the authors, but suggested to contain a simple descriptive string and information on location within the chapter.\n",
