      "Interferometry is a fundamental technique used in radio astronomy but is difficult to understand. The technique is rarely used in other fields of astronomy and physics. Many of our intutions about imaging, which comes from cameras and out own eyes, hide the underlying transformations which are central to interferometer theory. With this book we hope to present a useful entry point into the topic by sticking to the fundamentals of the topic which is appropriate for a masters or doctoral student who is starting on the subject.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Notebook and Directory Naming Conventions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Each chapter is contained in a seperate directory, the directory name has the convention of the chapter number and chapter name, with spaces replaced by underscores, e.g. `6_deconvolution_in_imaging`. The directory will only contain notebooks, any data or additional files will be in a seperate global data directory which includes a duplicately named directory for each chapter in which to store the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notebook naming should be prefixed with either a sequential number or alphabet character based on ordering in the chapter. Like directories, the notebook name should be the section name (with underscores to replace spaces), a shortened version of the section is also fine, e.g. `A_sky_models.ipynb`.\n",

      "#### References, Internal and External:\n",
      "\n",
      "Linking to internal (i.e. within the same notebook) and external (i.e. other notebooks in the book) references will use a dual method of using the standard markdown HREF and a LaTeX style so that dynamic links will work in the notebooks and conversion to PDF via LaTeX will contain references.\n",
      "\n",
      "Internal links to references are created by adding the string `INREF` as the link, e.g. `[INREF](#destination)`. A reference is created by including `<a id='destination'></a>` where the desired reference desition is to be placed. In addition to the ipython notebook dynamic links LaTeX references should be included with the `\\label{destination}` and `\\ref{destination}` tags. An example of a complete internal reference is\n",

      "For citations to published work the LaTeX `\\cite{manuscript}` tag should be used for later conversion to PDF. In the dynamic notebook a link should be created with the string `CITE` to a web-based link to the work (e.g. the article abstract on a journal web site). An example of a complete citation is\n",

      "In order to maintain uniform and informative reference labels we will use a standard naming convention of the form `chapterStr:type:uniqueID` where `chapterStr` is a unqiue, descriptive string for a chapter or chapter subsection, `type` is the type of content beinging labelled, and `uniqueID` is a unique ID for the content. For example a table in the Imaging chapter which contains information on weights could have the label `imaging:tbl:weights`. The `chapterStr` for each chapter is to be defined by the authors. If a section of a chapter is sufficiently large it shoud have its own `chapterStr`, perhaps with the prefix including the chapter `chapterStr`. The following are valid strings for `type`: `tbl` (table), `fig` (figure), `sec` (section), `code` (code block), `eq` (equation). The `uniqueID` is left to the authors, but suggested to contain a simple descriptive string and information on location within the chapter.\n",
