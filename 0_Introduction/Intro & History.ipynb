    "## The double-slit experiment\n",
    "The basics of interferometry date back to Thomas Young's double-slit experiment of 1801 (\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment). In thsi experiment, a plate pierced by two parallel slits is illuminated by a monochromatic source of light. Due to the wave-like nature of light, the waves passing through the two slits *interfere*, resulting in an *interference pattern*, or *fringe*, projected onto a screen behind the slits:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/514px-Doubleslit.svg.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The position on the screen $P$ determines the phase difference between the two arriving wavefronts. Waves arriving in phase interfere constructively and produce bright strips in the interference pattern. Waves arriving out of phase interfere destructively and result in dark strips in the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll construct a toy model of a dual-slit experiment. Note that this model is not really physically accurate, it is literally just a \"toy\" to help us get some intuition for what's going on. A proper description of interfering electromagnetic waves will follow later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, consider that, simlistically, a monochromatic electromagnetic wave with wavelength $\\lambda$ can be described by a complex quantity with an amplitude and an instantaneous phase, $A\\mathrm{e}^{\\imath\\phi}$. For simplicity, let us assume a constant amplitude $A$, while the phase of course varies as a function of time and position. If the same wave travels along two paths of different lengths and recombines at point $P$, the resulting electric field is a sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E=A\\mathrm{e}^{\\imath\\phi}+A\\mathrm{e}^{\\imath(\\phi-\\phi_0)},$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the phase delay $\\phi_0$ corresponds to the pathlength difference $\\tau_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\phi_0 = 2\\pi\\tau_0/\\lambda.$\n",
    "\n",
    "What is actually \"measured\" on the screen, the ***brightness***, is, physically, a time-averaged electric field intensity $EE^*$ (this exactly what our eyes, or a photographic plate, or a detector in the camera perceive as \"brightness\"). We can work this out as\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "EE^* = (A\\mathrm{e}^{\\imath\\phi}+A\\mathrm{e}^{\\imath(\\phi-\\phi_0)})(A\\mathrm{e}^{-\\imath\\phi}+A\\mathrm{e}^{-\\imath(\\phi-\\phi_0)}) = 2 A^2 + A^2( \\mathrm{e}^{\\imath\\phi_0} + \\mathrm{e}^{-\\imath\\phi_0} ) = 2 A^2 + 2 A^2 \\cos{\\phi_0}.\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how phase itself has dropped out, and the only thing that's left is the phase difference $\\phi_0$. The first part of the sum is a constant, while the second part varies with phase difference $\\phi_0$, which in turn depends on position on the screen $P$. It is easy to see that the resulting intensity $EE^*$ is a purely real quantity that varies from 0 to $4A^2$. This is exactly what produces the alternating bright and dark stripes on the screen.\n"

    "## Aperture synthesis vs. targeted experiments\n",
    "Interferometry was born as a way of conducting specific, targeted, and rather exotic experiments. The 1920 Betelgeuse size measurement is a typical example. In contrast to a classical optical telescope, which could directly obtain an image of the sky containing information on hundreds to thousands of objects, an interferometer was a very delicate apparatus for indirectly measuring a single physical quantity (the size of the star in this case). The spatial resolution of that single measurement far exceeded anything available to a conventional telescope, but in the end it was always a specific, one-off measurement. The first interferometers were not capable of directly imaging the sky at that improved resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In radio interferometry, all this changed in the late 1960s with the development of the *aperture synthesis* technique by Sir Martin Ryle's group in Cambridge. The crux of this tehnique lies in combining the information from multiple baselines. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this point, consider the following. As you saw from playing with the toy double-slit simulator above, for each baseline length, the interference pattern conveys a particular piece of information about the sky. For example, the following three \"skies\" yield exactly the same interference pattern on a particular baseline, so a single measurement would be unable to distinguish between them:"

    "With a larger number of baselines, we can gather enough information to reconstruct an image of the sky. This is because each baseline essentially measures one *Fourier component* of the sky brightness distribution (Chapter 4 will explain this in more detail); and once we know the Fourier components, we can compute a Fourier transform in order to recover the sky image. The advent of sufficiently powerful computers in the late 1960s made this technique practical, and turned radio interferometers from exotic contraptions into generic imaging instruments. With a few notable exceptions, modern radio interferometry ***is*** aperture synthesis.\n",
