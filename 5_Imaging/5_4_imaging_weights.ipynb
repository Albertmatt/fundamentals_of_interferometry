    "The sampling function, as seen in the Section 5.2 KAT-7 examples, are made up of the various baseline tracks which leads to holes and overlapping sampling. So far we have discussed sampling functions as if they are binary functions, a visibility domain pixel is given a value of 1 if a baseline track measured that location otherwise the pixel was given a value of 0. The allocation of 0 to each pixel which was not measured should make sense, as there is no information, and thuse that pixel can potentially have any value. But, for the measured pixels the sampling function value does not necessarily need to be 1. For example, say an observation results in 1000 uv positions being measured, and 100 of these positions were measured 10 times while the other 900 positions were only measured once. The 100 positions measured 10 times, will have a $\\sqrt{10}$ improvement in sensitivity compared to the other 900 positions, so perhaps those 100 spatial frequency modes should be given more weight in the resulting image because we are more sure about the accuracy of the measurement. Or, perhaps an array is made up of many different types of telescopes which leads to some baselines having a higher sensitivity to other baselines, such as in VLBI. Or, perhaps the science case is only interested in certain spatial frequencies, such as seperating point sources from large-scale gas structure. These are all examples of times when we would like to adjust our sampling function, which leads to a number of different options we need to understand when creating an image. In fact, there is no standard set of options to create an image from visibilities, a weighting function must always be decided upon before hand. The most common weighting function we must decide on is the density weighting function, but we will also discuss the beam taper and reliability weighting."
