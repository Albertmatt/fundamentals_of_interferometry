Generally, a telescope will have a frequency-dependent efficiency which have the effect of decreasing gain as the frequency increases. The feed will be tuned for a specific response, which can even introduce sharp features into the bandpass. Like the feed, the LNA will be tuned for a specific frequency response.

The use of these spectrum allocations introduce RFI into the environment. Typical RFI sources are FM radio (89-110 MHz) and GSM mobile (around 900 MHz and 1.8 GHz).\n",

    "If a signal is always detectable then it will have a duty cycle of 1. An RFI signal with a duty cycle of 1 is manageable if that signal is narrow band, and we are not interested in the sky signal at that frequency. The signal can be managed by either introducing a notch filter to attenuate the signal in the analogue path, or digitize the signal and 'flag' the frequency channels as not usable. If an RFI signal is wide band with a duty cycle near or at 1, then little can be done to suppress that signal and pick out the sky signal. But, if the duty cycle of the wide band signal is low then the entire band can be flagged for that short time period with a minimal loss to the sensitivity. A typical wide band signal is aircraft RADAR, which is very strong, but moves quickly through the beam."

    "After signal conditioning in the analogue front-end, we are ready to capture the signal into a digital form so that we can perform the correlations. The term digitization is worth thinking about for a moment, it is the process of taking a continuous-in-time, analogue signal (which is described by real numbers), and converting it to a discrete in time and voltage signal (which are 'digits' described by integers). The last analogue component is the *analogue to digital converter (ADC)*. A simple form of analogue to digital conversion is a cascading resistor ladder which measures discrete steps in an analogue signal, each output of the ladder triggers a bit value of either 0 or 1, thus a digital signal is created. A typical radio astronomy ADC might have 8 bits, that is the signal can take on 256 values (-128 to 127). There is a resolution to these steps, which introduces digitization noise to the signal as the continuous signal is truncated to the closest step. You can imagine that more bits will reduce this noise, as there will be more steps and the resolution will be smaller. Or, more bits can be used to increase the dynamic range of the ADC. Say there is a strong RFI source with a weak sky signal, we want to be able to sample the sky signal at the enough resolution, but also we need to fully sample the RFI signal. If the maximum ADC value is smaller than the RFI signal then the RFI will *saturate* the ADC, causing the output of the ADC to sit at the highest or lowest value and no sky signal can be captured. This is another reason why strong RFI is often managed in the analogue chain. The choice of number of bits and step resolution depend on the RFI environment, the amplification of the sky signal, and also the bandwidth of the ADC."

    "Digitization samples a continuous signal at regular intervals, this introduces a frequency ambiguity due to the $f_s$ sampling rate. With a sampling rate of $f_s$, the maximum frequency which can be resolved (the Nyquist frequency) is $f_s/2$. Frequencies above the Nyquist frequency are said to 'alias'. If we are only sampling at a rate of $f_s$ then any sine wave oscillating at a higher frequency can go through many cycles between sampling points. There exists another sine wave, going through fewer cycles at below the Nyquist frequency which will match in amplitude at the same sampling points. Thus these two sine wave can not be differentiated, in fact there are not just two but an infinite set of such waves due to the periodic nature of the sine wave. Knowing this, if we would like to Nyquist sample a 100 MHz band, then we need an ADC which samples at 200 MHz, with appropriate bandpass filters. This is a difficult topic and there are many books which will provide a thorough explanation of the topic, a good starting point is Richard Lyons' <cite data-cite='Lyons:2004:UDS:993484'>Understanding Digital Signal Processing</cite> [CITE](https://books.google.co.za/books?id=UBU7Y2tpwWUC)."

Then the two Fourier transformed signals are multiplied together (one of the signals is conjugated to make this a correlation instead of a convolution), and the resulting signal is then accumulated, this is the X component. As you might guess, the XF architecture does the two operations in a reverse order. There are a few reasons to choose one architectures over the other but, suffice to say the FX is generally favoured for computational reasons. The correlation of all antenna pairs is computationally intensive operation and is commonly implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or graphics processing units (GPUs)."

The Cooley-Tukey Radix-2 algorithm is the classic example of a FFT algorithm. An important note to make right here, you will often see FFTs of size $2^d$, i.e. 256, 512, 1024, etc., being used, this is because when a size of $2^d$ is used the most efficient FFT can be used.

The apparent factor of 2 'loss' in information due to the FFT is because the output of the FFT is complex and the input is real, so there are effectively 2 values per frequency subband. The more samples included in the window, the higher the resolution of subbands output. In the extreme case of an infinite window the DFT approaches the continuous Fourier Transform output. On the other side, a window of 1 sample will produce the same output as input.

This might not seem like an issue because none of the samples have been modified, but the continuity of the signal has been altered. When an FFT is applied to the window, from the convolution theorem, we are convolving the Fourier transform of the data with the Fourier transform of a top-hat function. The Fourier transform of the top-hat function is known as a *sinc function* which is defined as $\\textrm{sinc}(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$. The top-hat function is known as a *windowing function*, and it turns out to be a generally poor one. The primary issue with the top-hat function is that is that there are high 'sidelobes' with a 'slow' roll-off. Many other windowing functions have been developed: Hamming, Hann, Blackman, Gaussian, etc. These windowing functions have a trad off in the subband width, sidelobe levels, sidelobe roll-off, and sharpness. A simple example as to why you would want to apply a windowing function to samples is that if there is strong RFI in one subband, and the windowing function has high sidelobes (like a top-hat function), then power will *leak* from the RFI subband to clean subband, corrupting it.\n",
