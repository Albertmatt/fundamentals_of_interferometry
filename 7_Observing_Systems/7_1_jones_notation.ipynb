    "\n",
    "Jones notation, or ***Jones calculus***, forms the foundation of the radio interferometer measurement equation (RIME). Jones calculus is a mathematical description of the propagation of electromagnetic plane waves. The signal measured by any telescope is not a perfect representation of the original astrophysical signal, but is rather contaminated by successive layers of propagation effects as the signal makes its way from the astrophysical source to an actual measurement on our instrument. Jones notation gives us a mathematical way of describing these corruptions. The business of estimating and removing the corruptions is called **calibration** and is dealt with in [Chapter 8 &#10142;](../8_Calibration/8_0_Introduction.ipynb). In this section we simply introduce Jones notation and show how it can be used to describe propagation effects."

    "By definition of the Stokes parameters, a physical signal has the property $Q^2+U^2+V^2 \\le I^2$, i.e. the polarized fraction cannot exceed 100%. This seems obvious, however, a curious fact of radio interferometry is that it is possible to *observe* signals that appear to formally have polarization in excess of 100%. Recall from [Chapter 5](../5_Imaging/5_2_sampling_functions_and_psfs.ipynb) that an interferometer samples a limited set of spatial frequencies, as given by its shortest and longest baselines. Therefore, if the $I$ flux varies smoothly over the sky (i.e. has very low spatial frequencies, or large spatial scales) while the polarized $QU$ varies on smaller scales, it is quite possible for the interferometer to \"see\" less (or even no) $I$ flux, and significant $QU$ flux. This is in fact the case when observing near the plane of the Milky Way: unpolarized synchrotron radiation from around the galactic plane is very smooth (on the order of degrees), and gets mostly suppressed, while the *polarized foregrounds* have smaller-scale structure (on the order of arcminutes) that is quite apparent to most interefometers.
