    "The system electronics accounts for most of the variation and noise during an observation. And hence, are the most basic component of the RIME which must be properly modelled and, as we will see later, calibrated to recover the original signal. The system electronics encompasses all analogue and digital components which are used to to convert the electromagnetic signal to a conditioned voltage (via amplifiers and filters) and then compute the correlation between antennas (via FFT and multiplication) to produce the digital visibility. This system 'gain', denoted as $G$ in the RIME, has both a time and frequency-dependent effect on the signal."

But, the signal is very weak, and can be treated as approximately Gaussian noise. That noise is what we would like to measure, as that noise is from sources in the sky. But, there are other types of noise, which we don't want, leaking into the measurement. At the earliest possible point in the analogue receiver chain the signal must be amplified using a *low-noise amplifier*. To understand why this amplification is necessary we must start with the *system temperature*.\n",

The temperature of the sky varies depending on the observing frequency, for example at low frequency, say 100 MHz, the sky is close to 1000 K. The Earth is approximated as a 300 K black body. We can see that if even a small percentage of the ground is picked up in the receiver then the sky signal can be buried underneath, especially at higher frequencies. The design of the early stages of the analogue receiver chain must pay important attention to which components are used, as each one adds to the system temperature. There is additional noise from ground pickup, the atmosphere (depending on observing frequency), the antenna feed, filters, amplifier, and passive electronic components.\n",

The gain from the feed and passive components will be less than 1, and are similar to an efficiency term in when discussing the primary beam, these will cause the temperature from these components to increase in the system temperature. By having the LNA as early as possible we see that the weak sky signal is amplified, and noisier components such as filters and second stage amplifiers can be introduced without introducing significant noise compared to the sky signal. The LNA and the front-end analogue components are often cooled using a heat pump or a *cryostat*, a sealed vacuum container which can be cooled down to $\\sim 10$ Kelvin to reduce the system noise. For low-frequency systems the sky is 'hotter' than room temperature, so additional cooling offers minimal improvements in the system temperature."

    "The gain fluctuations of the electronics systems can often be seperated into two components. The time-stable frequency dependent component encapsulated in the *bandpass response*. The frequency-dependent structure of the sky is modified by the optics, receiver, analogue components, and the digital signal processing. Generally, a telescope will have a frequency-dependent efficiency which have the effect of decreasing gain as the frequency increases. The feed will be tuned for a specific response, which can even introduce sharp features into the bandpass. Like the feed, the LNA will be tuned for a specific frequency response. Importantly, in *heterodyne systems*, which take advantage of Nyquist aliasing, bandpass filters are used to create sharp cut-offs on the edges of the band. Often it is necessary to introduce notch filters to reduce the effect of *radio frequency interference (RFI)*. Though the relative bandpass response can change with time, it is often slowly varying and can be consdiered stable for the duration of an observation.\n",

    "After signal conditioning in the analogue front-end, we are ready to capture the signal into a digital form so that we can perform the correlations. The term digitization is worth thinking about for a moment, it is the process of taking a continuous-in-time, analogue signal (which is described by real numbers), and converting it to a discrete in time and voltage signal (which are 'digits' described by integers). The last analogue component is the *analogue to digital converter (ADC)*. A simple form of analogue to digital conversion is a cascading resistor ladder which measures discrete steps in an analogue signal, each output of the ladder triggers a bit value of either 0 or 1, thus a digital signal is created. A typical radio astronomy ADC might have 8 bits, that is the signal can take on 256 values (-128 to 127). There is a resolution to these steps, which introduces digitization noise to the signal as the continuous signal is truncated to the closest step. You can imagine that more bits will reduce this noise, as there will be more steps and the resolution will be smaller. Or, more bits can be used to increase the dynamic range of the ADC. Say there is a strong RFI source with a weak sky signal, we want to be able to sample the sky signal at the enough resolution, but also we need to fully sample the RFI signal. If the maximum ADC value is smaller than the RFI signal then the RFI will *saturate* the ADC, causing the output of the ADC to sit at the highest or lowest value and no sky signal can be captured. This is another reason why strong RFI is often managed in the analogue chain. The choice of number of bits and step resolution depend on the RFI environment, the amplification of the sky signal, and also the bandwidth of the ADC."
