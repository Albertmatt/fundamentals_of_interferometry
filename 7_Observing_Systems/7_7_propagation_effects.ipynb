Since water vapour is poorely mixed in this layer, there are phase fluctuations introduced due to the refractive index inhomogenities that result. The delay due to a non-unity refractive index ($n$) is $$\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{c} \\int (n - 1) dy, $$ where c is the speed of light the refractive path length is the straight line path.

Since the atmosphere obeys the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium (to a good approximation), it is clear that to zero-th order, the trosphere's refractive index will have some dependence on time-of-day, time-of-season, site altitude and latitude.

    "***Figure 7.7.9***: Root phase structure function based on BnA array VLA 22 GHz observations. Open circles show the phase rms versus baseline length towards a 1 Jy calibrator source (0748+240) over the course of 90 minutes. The filled swquare show the same values with a constant noise value of 10$^\\circ$ subtracted in quadrature, revealing the underlying tropospheric structure functions. All three regimes are predicted by Kolomogorov turbulence theory. (Image credit: Carilli & Holdaway 1999) "
