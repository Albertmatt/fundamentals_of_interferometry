We can imagine being at a point on the celestial sphere looking down on to the baseline distribution. From this point, the baselines look projected to a 2-D plane. Later in the chapter we will discuss the [Van Cittert-Zernike Theorem &#10142;](4_5_The_Fourier_Approximation_VanCittert-Zernike_Theorem.ipynb) which allows an image of the sky to be constructed from an approximate 2-D Fourier transform between the baseline visibility sampling and the sky. There are many caveats to this theorem, but for now we are getting ahead of ourselves. At the moment what is important to understand is that for a given point on the celestial sphere the 3-D baselines can be projected onto a 2-D plane, and as the Earth rotates (and the Celestial sphere stays fixed) this changes the projection of each baseline. This change in projection is key to how we observe in radio astronomy, and will come up again later when we discuss [*uv* coverage &#10142;](4_4_1_UV_Coverage_UV_Tracks.ipynb)."

The first is by physically pointing the elements (this is not always true for transiting arrays) so that the primary beam (see [Chapter 7 &#10142;](../7_Observing_Systems/7_5_primary_beam.ipynb)) is pointed towards the source. But, this physical 'pointing' is not important yet, when we point an interferometric array we are talking about defining a *phase centre* by applying *fringe* or *delay tracking*. For an observation we define the *phase centre* as the point on the celestial sphere in the direction of the vector $\\mathbf{s_0}$. We will come back to this definition in the discussion of the 2-element interferometer in [$\\S$ 4.2 &#10142;](4_2_The_2-element_Interferometer.ipynb). Fringe tracking is the geometrical 'delay' correction to applied during (or some cases after) an observation to define a phase centre.
