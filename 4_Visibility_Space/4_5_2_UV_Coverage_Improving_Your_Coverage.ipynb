Due to the motion of the Earth, the sampled spatial frequency (at coordinate $u$, $v$) will follow the $uv$ track.\n",

    "In [$\\S$ 4.4.2 &#10549;](4_4_2_UV_Coverage_Improving_Your_Coverage.ipynb), we addressed three different ways of enriching the $uv$ coverage. First, we can increase the number of antennas and its distribution to improve the instantaneous spatial frequency coverage. Second, we can use the fact that the observed source are moving with the Celestial Sphere (due to Earth rotation). The continuous variation of the projected baseline, and therefore, of the $u$, $v$ coordinates, allow to sample portion of the elliptical $uv$ tracks, for each baseline. A long integration time allow to naturally cover the $uv$ plane without any additional expense than computing the signals correlation at a higher temporal rate (which depend on the desired temporal resolution of each sample). Third, with the use of broadband receivers, we can sample the visibilities at various frequencies by computing the cross-correlation in different frequency channels. With this principle, the $uv$ coverage can also be improved along radial $uv$ tracks.\n",
