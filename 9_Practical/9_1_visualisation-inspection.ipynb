    "```\n",

    "There are two ways of executing CASA tasks. The first, \"interactive\", the first is to list the task parameters and set them one by one. And, the second, \"non-interactive\",  is by executing the tasks as you would any other python function. For example, the *listobs* task gives a summary information about an MS. This task can be executed interactively like this:\n",
