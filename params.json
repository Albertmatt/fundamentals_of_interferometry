Each student will present their results in a 5-10 minute presentation on the final day. Students will be given the opportunity to revise their report in the week after the talks.\r\n\r\n## Notebook Setup\r\n\r\nTo setup the ipython notebook environment to interactively use the book follow the [virtualenv setup guide](https://github.com/griffinfoster/fundamentals_of_interferometry#setup-contributor-virtualenv).\r\n\r\n## Data\r\n\r\nThere are additional large files (> 1MB), mainly FITS images, which are needed for some of the sections, these can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3jyiajytwuldpu/fundamentals_fits.tar.gz?dl=0), the original simulated KAT-7 measurement sets can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kb3p2mthei8dgl9/simulated_KAT-7_ms.tar.gz?dl=0).\r\n\r\n## External Software\r\n\r\nFor data reduction we will be using NRAO's [CASA](http://casa.nrao.edu/) software package.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n* Marcellin Atemkeng\r\n* Landman Bester\r\n* Tariq Blecher\r\n* Roger Deane\r\n* Griffin Foster\r\n* Julien Girard\r\n* Trienko Grobler\r\n* Benna Hugo\r\n* Gyula (Josh) Jozsa\r\n* Jonathan Kenyon\r\n* Sphesihle Makhathini\r\n* Modhurita Mitra\r\n* Ridhima Nunhokee\r\n* Simon Perkins\r\n* Laura Richter\r\n* Oleg Smirnov\r\n* Kshitij Thorat\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
